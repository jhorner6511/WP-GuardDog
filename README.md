# WP-GuardDog
A WP Plug-in that goes above and beyond to protect your website's content.

This plug-in for WordPress will prevent users from doing the following:

1. Prevent taking screenshots either from apps or browser extensions
2. Prevent downloading images or videos by disabling right-click option on the mouse
3. Prevent downloading images or videos by disabling browser extenstions
4. Prevent screen recorders from being used on your website from apps or browser extensions.

This plugin is not foolproof as their are countless ways around the preventive methods above, but in most cases, this will prevent users from stealing content from your website.

Any suggestions or additional feature request are welcomed.

Enjoy!
